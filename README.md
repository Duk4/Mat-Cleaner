# Small web app that determines who will be the next cleaners

> At the end of every BJJ training, coach asks: 'Who didn't clean the mats the longest?'.
> As you can assume, there won't be many of us that will step up to the plate.
> Many have never cleaned them and others done it more often than not.
> So, in order to make things easier and more transparent, I made this app, which gives us our cleaners.

## How does it work?

> 1. You check the present team members
> 2. You press the submit button
> 3. You get names of three cleaners
>
> Cleaners are picked by comparing their last cleaning date

## What I learned during this project?
> - DOM Manipulation
> - Local Storage
> - JSON
> - JavaScript Date Objects
> - Many other stuff that I thought were needed

- members.js - deals with collecting data and showing the form
- main.js - the heart of app, does everything after submiting the form, saves changes
